Building on the success of previous editions <a href="/blogs/moose2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 15px;">MOOSE 2025 Recap</a>, MOOSE 2026 expands both in scale and scope, offering a comprehensive hands-on training experience complemented by strong pedagogical lectures.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 1.2rem;">The workshop is designed for researchers and students interested in neuroscience and systems biology. The program will feature expert-led lectures, guided tutorials, and intensive hands-on sessions, building from foundational concepts in neuroscience to simulating molecular mechanisms and modelling neuronal networks with MOOSE.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 1.2rem;">Further details on dates, speakers, program structure, and applications will be announced soon.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 700; margin-top: 1.5rem;">Stay tuned!</p>
