### **v4.1.4** — Incremental Release over **v4.1.1**

**GitHub:** <span class="text-blue-600">[Release v4.1.4 — Incremental Release over v4.1.1](https://github.com/MooseNeuro/moose-core/releases/tag/v4.1.4)</span>

Incremental Release 4.1.4 improves stability, correctness, and usability. It fixes rare issues with evaluation and crashes in function objects, stabilizes expression parsing, and simplifies the Function API. SWC morphology import is enhanced with a clearer hierarchical naming scheme for dendritic compartments, making neuron structures easier to interpret and debug.
