We are excited to announce MOOSE 2026, an extensive workshop on multiscale modelling with MOOSE. Building on the success of previous editions [MOOSE 2025 Recap](/blogs/moose2025), MOOSE 2026 expands both in scale and scope, offering a comprehensive hands-on training experience complemented by strong pedagogical lectures.

The workshop is designed for researchers and students interested in neuroscience and systems biology. The program will feature expert-led lectures, guided tutorials, and intensive hands-on sessions, building from foundational concepts in neuroscience to simulating molecular mechanisms and modelling neuronal networks with MOOSE.

Further details on dates, speakers, program structure, and applications will be announced soon.

Stay tuned!
