### **v4.1.1** — Incremental Release over **v4.1.0** *(Jhangri!)*


**GitHub:** [Release v4.1.1 — Incremental Release over v4.1.0 “Jhangri”](https://github.com/MooseNeuro/moose-core/releases/tag/v4.1.1)

The latest release is now available to install from PyPI via `"pip"`. The incremental release further brings performance improvements, new features, API updates, key bug fixes, more detailed documentation, and enhanced stability.

> **Trivia:** *Jhangri* is an Indian sweet in the shape of a flower. It is made of white-lentil batter, deep-fried in ornamental shapes to form the crunchy, golden body, which is then soaked in sugar syrup lightly flavoured with spices.
